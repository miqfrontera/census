# Census project
This is a side project whose main purpose is to help to get a register of people who emigrated to other places. The main features are:
* A backend to introduce people information and the year of their emigration
* This backend should allows to search, edit and delete those registers.
* Only authorized users could has access to this backend.
* Some web pages, with no restricted access, that allows to do searches for the info registered in the backend

Also it might help me to practice with some interesting things before use in real projects:
* TDD
* Continuous integration with [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/)
* Github issues, milestones and project features to control all that stuff
* Some libraries I want to test that could be interesting to use in real projects

So, this is only a project to play and learn with some kind of features with the only purpose to know new interesting things :-)
